# Predicting invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in tissue slices
## Motivation & Background
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is a type of cancer that develops in a milk duct and invades the fibrous or fatty breast tissue outside the duct. It is the most common form of breast cancer forming 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Histology is the study of the microscropic structure of tissues.


## Dataset Description
- 279 patients
- 277,524 image patches of size 50*50 extracted from 162 whole mount slide images of breast cancer speciemens scanned at 40x. 198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive.

## What can be done next
- Develop a live web app to help speed up a pathologist's workflow and provide diagnosis support
